### What is Currying

Currying comes from mathmatics. It is the transformation of a function that takes multiple
arguments into a function that takes only one argument that returns a function that
takes then next argument in line repeated until it can return a result.

It just means instead of passing all the arguments to a function at once, and getting a result, you can `apply`
some of the arguments to a function and get back a function that takes the rest of the arguments.

That means turning a function like `add2Numbers` into `curriedAdd2Numbers` as shown below.

```javascript
function add2Numbers(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
let six = add2Numbers(2, 4);

const curriedAdd2Numbers = (x) => (y) => x + y;
let five = curriedAdd2Numbers(2)(3);
```

If you're like me you see the example above and think "Why would I do that?". It doesn't seem so useful.
I'll admit with the example of adding numbers it isn't, but currying is a powerful tool to add to your belt.

My goal is to explain currying in an aproachable way.
That by the end of this you can see currying as a useful tool and be able to use it in your own code. Maybe you'll
even be excited enough about it to dig further into currying and functional programming.

The power of currying comes from partial application paired with JavaScripts ability to
pass functions as arguments.

For us that means 2 things. We can capture functions with some arguments already applied to create more
specialized reusable functions and we can apply arguments to our functions as we pass
them around until we have everything we need to call them.

### Partial application

Currying let's us take a generic function apply a few arguments and capture the result.
This is nice when you find your self passing the same arguments to a function over and over.

A prime example of this is a logging function with levels. In our example we have a logger that
takes a level and a message. During runtime it checks the level of the message with the level of
our global setting to determine wether it should show the message.

```javascript
const GLOBAL_DEBUG_LEVEL = "warning";
const LEVELS_RANK = {
  error: 1,
  warning: 2,
  info: 3,
  debug: 4,
};

function logger(level, message) {
  if (LEVELS_RANK[level] <= LEVELS_RANK[GLOBAL_DEBUG_LEVEL]) {
    console.log(`${level}: ${message}`);
  }
}

logger("info", "this seems like a bad idea");
logger("warning", "you should probably stop");
logger("warming", "why are you like this ðŸ˜¢");
logger("error", "I don't want to say I told you so, but...");
```

By currying our logging function, and applying the level, we can create some
sweet specialized logging functions and save ourselves from a possibly hard to find typo.

```javascript
// by currying on the go we can get around functions where we might
// not have access to change the order of the arguments, or don't want to
const logError = (message) => logger("error", message);
logError("oops, forgot to declare it");

// we could pass the message first if
// for some reason we knew our message but not what level it should be
// This isn't very clear what we're logging
// But it does show that its something we could do if we wanted
const logMessage = (level) => logger(level, `check our my sweet variable`);
logMessage("debug");

// this is a function that transforms a normal function
// into a curried function that accepts 1 or more arguments at a time
// until it has enough arguments to invoke the function it was given
//
// order of the arguments is important in this implementation
function curry(func) {
  return function currier(...args) {
    // if we have all of our args lets call our function
    if (args.length >= func.length) {
      return func(...args);
    }

    // if not lets add a wrapper that can take more arguments
    return (...moreArgs) => currier(...args, ...moreArgs);
  };
}

// curriedLogger(level)(message)
const curriedLogger = curry(logger);
// we apply our level
logInfo = curriedLogger("info");
logWarning = curriedLogger("warning");

// apply our message, and complete the function call
logInfo(
  "because of our implementation we can pass all the arguments if we wanted too"
);

curriedLogger("info", "This would act just like the original function");
```

Technically currying means we should be passing one argument at a time, but let's call it
a suggestion. In Javascript there is nothing stopping us from applying more than
one argument at a time as long as we call them in the right order. We can even bend the rules
on argument order by wrapping our logger as we go in a function that takes the missing arguments.

### Curry kind of like courier

I can't help but think about a curried function as a courier.
Each time a curried function is called it is like it stopped to pick up a package. When
the truck is full and it has everything it needs it can deliver.

```javascript
let deliver = console.log;

// courier needs to pick up 3 packages before they can deliver
const courier = (packageA) => (packageB) => (packageC) =>
  deliver(`${packageA}, ${packageB}, ${packageC}`);

function doRoute(courier) {
  // each package is only available in the scope of it's post office
  // The Courier Starts at the state post office
  statePost(courier);
}

function statePost(courier) {
  // This package is only available inside the state post office
  let package = "Nintendo Switch";
  // the courier picks up the package
  let courierWithOnePackage = courier(package);
  // then goes to the next stop
  countyPost(courierWithOnePackage);
}

function countyPost(courier) {
  // This package is only available inside the county post office
  let package = "Animal Crossing";
  // the courier picks up the package
  let courierWith2Packages = courier(package);
  // then goes to the next stop
  localPost(courierWith2Packages);
}

function localPost(courier) {
  // This package is only available inside the county post office
  let package = "Letter from Mom";
  // the courier picks up the final package and can finally deliver
  courier(package);
}

doRoute(courier);
```

In no one place was our courier able to pick up all of the packages at once. Every time they
passed into a new post office they were able to grab the package from that location. When we had
all the packages we were finally able to invoke the deliver function.

Let's expand on this concept even further by checking out a grocery list app.

we'll have a class called `GroceryListUI` that calls 2 other functions, `createItemRowWithQuantity`
and `createQuantityForm`, to build our grocery list app.

We want to keep our api logic in the `GroceryListUI` class to make our other functions more
reusable. Maybe `createQuantityForm` and `createItemRowWithQuantity` live in other files and are reused
in parts of our app to handle quantity of items we have in our pantry, or items being transported.

Let's look at our components individually, then all together with only the code that deals with currying.

First we have a class called `GroceryListUI` that takes an element
and a list of grocery items. It calls the other functions to build
the UI and attach it to the DOM.

```javascript
// creates our grocery list ui and attached it to the item passed
class GroceryListUI {
  constructor(element, items) {
    // element we attach our list to
    this.element = element;
    this.element.append(...this.makeGroceryList(items));
  }

  // iterates over our list of items and turns it into a list of dom elements
  makeGroceryList(items) {
    // map over the list of items and create the elements for each one
    return items.map((item) =>
      // our next function
      createItemRowWithQuantity(item, this.updateItemQuantity)
    );
  }

  // curried API call where we need a function that hits an item endpoint,
  // and id of what item to update, and the value we want to update
  curriedApiCall = (apiCall) => (itemId) => (valueChangeEvent) => {
    let newValue = valueChangeEvent.target.value;
    apiCall(itemId, newValue);
  };

  // applying our first argument to create a specialized function
  // for updating item Quantity
  updateItemQuantity = this.curriedApiCall(putToItemQuantityEndpoint);

  // if we wanted to add a feature to change the name of our item we can
  // easily extend our curriedApiCall to do it
  updateItemName = this.curriedApiCall(putToItemNameEndpoint);
}
```

We have a function called `createItemRowWithQuantity` that takes a grocery item object
and a function that calls our curried update function. It returns an element that well use as a
row in our grocery list with the item name and a form to update the quantity.

```javascript
// takes a single object called item, and a function used to update an item.
// returns an element that represents a row in our grocery list with a form inside it.
function createItemRowWithQuantity(item, updateItemQuantity) {
  // create row
  let element = document.createElement("div");

  // add the grocery item name so we know what we need
  let name = document.createElement("h2");
  name.textContent = item.name;

  // apply the item Id so we know what Item to update
  let updateThisItem = updateItemQuantity(item.id);

  // use the quantity and callback function to create our little form
  let form = createQuantityForm(item.quantity, updateThisItem);

  // attach our new elements and send back our grocery item
  element.append(name, form);
  return element;
}
```

`createQuantityForm` takes an initial quantity value and our update function. It returns a small form element

```javascript
// takes a Number Quantity and a callback function
// returns a simple form with an input that holds an initial value.
function createQuantityForm(quantity, updateThisItemsQuantity) {
  // Create our form
  let form = document.createElement("form");

  // create the label for our input
  let label = document.createElement("label");
  label.textContent = "quantity";

  // create our input
  let input = document.createElement("input");
  // pass our input the value from our database
  input.value = quantity;
  // attach a listener that will invoke our callback function
  // when the input value changes and the input loses focus
  input.addEventListener("change", updateThisItemsQuantity);

  // put our pieces together and send them back
  label.append(input);
  form.append(label);
  return form;
}
```

You may have noticed `GroceryListUI` doesn't know what item will need to be updated, or what
the updated value is, but it does know what function to call to hit our endpoint
and update the item in the database. The element returned from `createItemRowWithQuantity` knows
what item is going to be updated, and the form returned from `createQuantityForm`
knows what the new value is. Sounds like a great time for our courier ðŸ˜‰

All together now.

you can also see a working example on [this codepen](https://codepen.io/KerstingJosh/pen/VwammPJ?editors=0011)

```javascript
class GroceryListUI {
  // ...

  // curried API call where we need a function that hits an item endpoint,
  // and id of what item to update, and the value we want to update
  curriedApiCall = (apiCall) => (itemId) => (valueChangeEvent) => {
    let newValue = valueChangeEvent.target.value;
    apiCall(itemId, newValue);
  };

  // lets do our first application and create a specialized function
  // for updating item Quantity
  updateItemQuantity = this.curriedApiCall(putToItemQuantityEndpoint);

  // if we wanted to add a feature to change the name of our item we can
  // easily extend our curriedApiCall to do it
  updateItemName = this.curriedApiCall(putToItemNameEndpoint);

  makeGroceryList(items) {
    // map over the list of items and create the elements for each one
    return items.map((item) =>
      // this arrow function calls our create function and passes the
      // partially applied function updateItemQuantity
      createItemRowWithQuantity(item, this.updateItemQuantity)
    );
  }
}

function createItemRowWithQuantity(item, updateItemQuantity) {
  // ...

  // now apply the item Id and create a function specialized
  // for updating this specific item
  let updateThisItemsQuantity = updateItemQuantity(item.id);

  // use the quantity and updateThisItemsQuantity as callback function to create our form
  let form = createQuantityForm(item.quantity, updateThisItemsQuantity);

  // ...
}

function createQuantityForm(quantity, updateThisItemsQuantity) {
  // ...

  // our paritally applied function now knows what endpoint to hit,
  // what item to update. when this event listener fires it will
  // get the new value and complete our function call
  input.addEventListener("change", updateThisItemsQuantity);

  // ...
}
```

In our class we started with a curried function called `curriedApiCall` as our base.
We only knew what action to call so we applied `putToItemQuantityEndpoint` and captured
its value to create `updateItemQuantity`.

Next, like our courier, our curried function is passed into `createItemRowWithQuantity`.
In this function our list of items has been narrowed down to 1 item, so we can apply its
id and create a function called `updateThisItem`.

We pass `updateThisItem` into `createQuantityForm` where it's used as a
callback function to our inputs event listener.

Now when we update our values in the grocery list the event listener is called and applies
our final argument, the new value, to our curried function. With that the function is
fully applied and we update our database!

### Summary

Currying is an incredibly useful technique you can start using right away. It let's you create reusable functions,
and capture arguments as a curried function is passed into the scope of other functions.
