### What's A Variable?

A variable is just a name we use to refer to data in our program.
JavaScript gives us 3 keywords to declare variables `var`, `let`, and `const`.

```javascript
let myVariable = "grapefruit";

const myConstant = "banana";

var myVar = "orange";
```

Other than the keywords we use, they dont seem so different,
but each gives the name we use some unique characterisitics.

### Variable scope

All variables live within a scope, the area of the code where we can access them.
`let` and `const` are block scoped. That means the varibles they create live in a
specific block of code and don't leave it. `var` on the other hand is function scoped and will spread as
far as it can inside a function. If it wasnt declared in a function it will spread
through the entire program. `var` is older and isn't used as much because this
behavior can lead to some "VARy" tricky bugs.

```javascript
// a block is as a section of code inside curly brackets
// sometimes it has a guard like if, else, or while
// sometimes there is no guard
if (true) {
  // these only exist inside the if block
  let a = "a";
  const b = "b";

  // this is declared globally
  var c = "c";
}

// var ignores block scope
// so we can use it here
c = "sea";
console.log(c);

// let and const stay in their house
// we cant use them out here
console.log(a, b);

// a function is the only guard that can keep a var inside
function someFunc() {
  var d = "d";
}

// this doesnt work because d was prevented from escaping
// by the function keyword
console.log(d);
```

Another thing that makes `var` tricky is you can redeclare it.
That means you can accidentally overwrite a variable when you dont mean to.

```javascript
let cat = "cute";
var kitten = "cuter";
const dog = "cutest";

// this is allowed by js
var kitten = "fluffy";

// these will cause errors
let cat = "soft";
const dog = "cuddly";
```

### Variable Reassignment

`let` and `var` are very similar in that, besides their scope, they act the same.
You can reuse the names and assign new values to them as much as you want.
`const` on the other hand is a one time assignment.

`const` is short for constant and semantically means the value held by this variable should not change.
Notice I say "Should Not". In JavaScript data types can be `primitive`, meaning we pass around the actual value,
or `reference` types where we pass the address that tells us where the value lives.
Numbers, Booleans, and Strings are examples of `primitive` types.
Arrays and Objects are examples of `reference` types.

Used with primitive values `const` acts how you would expect. When you assign a Number
to a constant variable you can't change it. the constant will always be that value.
When you use it with a reference value it always points to that reference. `const`
points us to an address that always get us to the right house, but we have no way to
be sure someone hasn't moved all the furniture around.
That means if you assign an array to a constant it will always point to the same array,
but it doesnt prevent the contents of the array from changing.

```javascript
// we can reassign the variables we create with let
let taco = "delicious";
taco = "my favorite"; // notice we dont use `let` to reassign a value

// const can not be reassigned
const howManyTacosICanEat = 5;
howManyTacosICanEat = 100;

// we cant assign a new value, but because its a reference
// data type we can change the data that it holds
const favoriteKindsOfTacos = ["beef", "chicken"];
favoriteKindsOfTacos.push("steak");
```

### Summary

Javscript lets you declare 3 types of varibles, `var`, `let`, and `const`.
`var` has some quirks with scope and reassignment, and it isn't used much anymore.
`let` and `const` are block scoped. `let` is a variable you can reassign and
`const` is a variable you dont want to change.
